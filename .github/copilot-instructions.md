# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

## Project Overview
This is a simple Python project for learning and experimentation. The current structure consists of a single module:

- `day01/helloworld.py`: Entry point for basic Python scripting. Contains introductory code, typically a print statement or simple logic.

## Architecture & Patterns
- **Flat Structure**: All code is currently in one file. No complex modules, packages, or service boundaries.
- **No External Dependencies**: The project does not use third-party libraries or frameworks.
- **No Configuration Files**: There are no build scripts, test runners, or environment files present.

## Developer Workflows
- **Run Code**: Execute scripts directly using Python:
  ```powershell
  python day01/helloworld.py
  ```
- **No Build/Test Automation**: There are no automated build or test commands. Manual execution only.
- **Debugging**: Use standard Python debugging tools (e.g., print statements, IDE debugger).

## Conventions
- **File Naming**: Folders are named by day (`day01`), indicating a learning or daily progress pattern.
- **Script Style**: Code is written in a single file, suitable for small exercises or demonstrations.
- **No Special Patterns**: No custom decorators, classes, or advanced Python features are used at this stage.

## Guidance for AI Agents
- Focus on simplicity and clarity. Assume code additions will be small and self-contained.
- When adding new exercises, follow the `dayXX/filename.py` pattern.
- If expanding, keep each day's work in its own folder for organization.
- Document any new conventions or workflows in this file as the project grows.

## Example
```python
# day01/helloworld.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

*Update this file as the project evolves to help future AI agents understand new patterns and workflows.*
